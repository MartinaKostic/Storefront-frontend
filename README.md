# Project info
This project is a Medusa storefront with two pages Home and Products page. The products page consist of all available products where you can also filter through different collections. You can get to the product details if you click on the wanted product. There you can find description of the product, available sizes and the prices in eur or USD currencies. Some of the functionalities are yet to be finished (like cart).

## Most challenging & most proud of

I found the Medusa integration the most challenging. I spent a lot of time studying the documentation in order to understand what the Medusa admin actually is, how the frontend and backend are connected and how to connect and set up everything. I would say that exact thing is what im the most proud of. 

## Project structure

I decided to separate all of the pages into its components. For the Product component i decided to also add Product Card component to avoid the reduredundance.
